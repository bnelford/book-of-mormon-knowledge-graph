I'm working on a Book of Mormon knowledge graph. I need to add [entity type] entities from [specific book/chapter]. 

Current entities include: [list a few examples from the JSON]

Please help me identify:
- Key [people/places/groups/events] from [book/chapter]
- Their scriptural references
- Their relationships to existing entities

Format the response as JSON following this structure:
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "unique_id",
      "label": "Display Name", 
      "type": "person|group|place|event",
      "references": ["Book Chapter:Verse"]
    }
  ],
  "edges": [
    {
      "from": "source_id",
      "to": "target_id", 
      "label": "relationship_type",
      "references": ["Book Chapter:Verse"]
    }
  ]
}
```

**2. Finding Relationships**
```
Analyze these Book of Mormon entities and identify relationships between them:

[Paste your entity list]

Focus on these relationship types:
- family relationships (parent_of, sibling_of, ancestor_of)
- social relationships (allied_with, opposed_by, taught_by)
